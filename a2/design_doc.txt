Design:
We designed the grammar by first inputting the grammar directly from the
language reference, then resolving each shift/reduce conflict produced
from the CUP parser generator. Here is a list of conflicts that arose
and how we fixed them:

  statement: hanging else

  expression: two sources of recursion

  nonterminal COMMA nonterminal:

  variable/array/function/parameter/procedurename:


Testing:
We included our a1 programs as passing tests, and mistakes from a1 as 
failing tests. We also added a number of extra tests - the purpose of each
test is described in comments at the top of each file
