(new) indicates this test is new since previous assignments

tests under passing are expected to pass and tests under failing are expected to fail.

Testing process:
Our testing process involves running automated passing/failing tests.
For passing tests we include write statements to print out values, and the testing 
script checks the printed values against the expected values which are defined in
a separate file. For failing tests the script just checks that the correct error
is thrown.

Passing:
========
(new) array_subexpn_lb:
check that an array with negative lb gets initialized, and indexing returns correct value

(new) array_subexpn_ub:
check that an array with ub gets initialized and indexing returns correct value

(new) assign_idents_LHS_RHS:
assign constants/basic expressions to variables and check that they get the correct value.
check that identExpns work correctly on both sides (LHS and RHS) of an assignStmt

(new) assign_outer_var:
check that assigning a value to a variable in an outer scope works

(new) cond_expn:
check that condition expression evaluates the correct branch for both true and false

(new) if_stmt:
check that unnested if statements evaluate the correct branch and continue correctly

(new) if_without_else:
check that unnested if statements without an 'else' case evaluates and continues correctly

(new) not_expn:
check that not flips boolean value correct

(new) read_stmt_basic:
check that a value gets read into a variable

(new) read_stmt_write:
check that values get read into variables and overwrite their values properly

check that lte evaluates to correct value

(new) write_neq1:
check that not = evalutes to correct value

(new) write_text_const:
check that text is written out correctly

(new) exit_basic:
can exit through single while loop

(new) exit_nested:
check that exit (with no level specified) in an inner loop exits exactly 1 loop

(new) exit_when_basic:
check that exit exits correctly when expn is true

(new) exit_when_basic2:
check that exit does not exit when expn is false

(new) exit_when_nested:
check that exit when expn is true exits correct number of loops inside nested loop

(new) exit_nested2:
check that exit exits the correct number of loops when the number of levels is
greater than 1
